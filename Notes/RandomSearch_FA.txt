Random research and FA algorithm (collision not computed):

initialize map, M
initialize number, n, of agents
initialize position of each agent to home position
max_iteration = set maximum iteration, before agent must return to home base to recharg
for each agent (not correct. Each agent has to take a step at a time)
    object_found = false
    curr_iteration = 0
    while !object_found or (max_iteration >= curr_iteration) do
        r = FA or randomly select new position from neighbouring positions (agent can not choose previously visited points) //consider edgecase where it is stuck in a path and can't move forward as it will revisit its previously points
        store r into array of visited points (make a trail/route)
        if sensor <= then
            object_found = true
            other_agents = check if other agents are at the object
            agent_push = true/false // true if agent can push object alone or with others, false otherwise
            while agent_push do
                turn on light
                other_agents = check if other agents are at the object
                agent_push = true/false // true if agent can push object alone or with others, false otherwise
            if other_agents then
                find best route home between agents
                while !home do
                    push object collectively home
            else
                push object home by route it came from
        curr_iteration + 1
