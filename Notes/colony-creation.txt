Create a homogeneous colony:
    1. tot_weight = total colony weight 
    2. num_agents = random number of agents in range 2-100 
    3. a_weight = weight per agent (tot_weight/num_agents)
    4. m_weight = a random motor weight (rand(0.0-1.0)*a_weight)
    5. battery weight (a_weight - m_weight)
    6. size of agent based on a_weight
